![No image found!](logo.png)
AutoPush is a small program to do the pushing to github, automatically! Once your  local github repo is ready to push, just enter "autopush" in the commandline and it will do the pushing for you. No need to enter 3 or 4 git commands. Using AutoPush you need to type only one!

# Installation

`git clone https://github.com/mrmidnight7331/autopush.git`

`cd autopush`

`chmod +x install.sh`

`sudo ./install.sh your-git-token` 

`autopush`

# Usage

In a github repo directory, enter the command "autopush", you will be prompted to enter the changes in commit via your preset text editor. Your github access token is then being copied in your clipboard. When it asks for your credentials, enter your github username, and CTRL + SHIFT + V to auto paste the token.
